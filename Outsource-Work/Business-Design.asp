	<h2>Logo Design</h2>

	<p>We stand behind the philosophy that a good logo has to do more than just look pretty; it has a functional purpose. Your business image depends on a logo design that is polished, distinctive, and memorable. Our designers understand the specific functionality of quality logo design. Benefits for advertising and marketing professionals.</p>
	<ul><li>After all, nothing is more important than the overall quality of your logo.</li></ul>
	<p>With Roosoft, you don't have to sacrifice quality even if your custom design project is on a tight deadline. Once you send us the information about your company, our designers immediately go to work to create your new company logo. You'll see your first logo design concepts in just 4 business days!</p>
	<p>According to the Graphic Artists Guild you'll pay $2,000 to $10,000 for a corporate logo at a traditional design firm. You can get a company logo from Roosoft for only $499. And since each of our graphic designers are specialists in logo design, you'll get a higher quality logo design at a better price.</p>
	<ul><li>We will make sure you get a logo you love and we'll be there to make sure it happens.</li></ul>
	<p>Why risk hiring a professional logo design firm that doesn't guarantee their work? If they don't have enough confidence in their work to offer a satisfaction guarantee you may want to reconsider hiring them! We know our logo designers are top notch. We are confident they will provide you with a logo design you will be proud of.</p>

	<h2>Business Cards, Letterhead and Envelopes</h2>
	
	<p>Nothing makes a business look more credible than professionally designed stationery. At Roosoft we understand how to apply the colors and fonts of your logo to your business cards, letterhead and envelopes in order to create an image your customers will remember. Just like our logo design process, you'll receive multiple design concepts created by different designers and be able to revise those designs to your liking.</p>
	<p>An investment in professionally designed stationery will pay off every time you hand out your business card and every time you send a letter. Your business cards are in competition with all the other cards that potential customers and investors collect throughout the year. To make sure your cards don't get thrown out, a good impression matters. Professionally designed stationery helps to form a lasting impression in the minds of your employees, business partners and customers. They'll not only remember you, but they'll know that you're a serious business and that they can trust you.</p>
	<p>You can save a lot of money by ordering both your business logo and your business stationery as part of our Corporate I.D. Package.</p>

	<h2>Custom Brochures</h2>

Simply tell us what you want your brochure to communicate and we'll let you know exactly what your brochure design will cost. You'll see your first ideas in five days or less!</p>
