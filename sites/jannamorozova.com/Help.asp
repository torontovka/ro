						<div class="faqsubject">What is a down payment?</div>
						<div class="faqbody"><p>Very
						few homebuyers have the cash available to buy a home outright. Most of
						us will turn to a financial institution for a mortgage. However, even
						with a mortgage, you will need to raise the money for a down payment. </p><p>The
						down payment is that portion of the purchase price you furnish
						yourself. The amount of the down payment (which represents your
						financial stake, or the equity in your new home) should be determined
						well before you start house hunting. </p><p>The larger the down
						payment, the less your home costs in the end. With a smaller mortgage,
						interest costs will be lower and over time, this will add up to
						significant savings.</p></div>

						<div class="faqsubject">How much do I need for a down payment?</div>
						<div class="faqbody"><p>According
						to the guidelines of the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation
						(CMHC), one must have a minimum down payment of at least 5% of the
						total cost of the prospective property. With a down payment between 5 -
						19.99%, one's mortgage is deemed "high-ratio". A high ratio mortgage is
						subject to a CMHC premium in accordance with the following schedule: </p><p>With
						a down payment of 20% or greater, the mortgage is deemed
						"conventional". A conventional mortgage is not subject to any CMHC
						fees. Thus, a larger down payment represents a two-fold advantage to
						the prospective homebuyer. First, the prospective homebuyer will avoid
						CMHC premiums with 20% down payment. Secondly, a larger down payment
						will relate into smaller monthly payments, or a shorter amortization;
						both of which lead to interest savings over the life of the mortgage.</p></div>

						<p class="txtNormal"><a name="5"></a></p><div class="faqsubject">How can you use your RRSP to help you buy your first home? </div><div class="faqbody"><p>Today,
						about 50% of first-time homebuyers use their RRSP savings to help
						finance a down payment. With the federal government's Home Buyers'
						Plan, you can use up to $20,000 in RRSP savings ($40,000 for a couple)
						to help pay for your down payment on your first home. You then have 15
						years to repay your RRSP. </p><p>To qualify, the RRSP funds you are
						using must be on deposit for at least 90 days. You will also need a
						signed agreement to buy a qualifying home. </p><p>Even if you have
						already saved for your down payment, it may make good financial sense
						to access your savings through the Home Buyers' Plan. For example, if
						you had already saved $20,000 for a down payment - and assuming you
						still had enough "contribution room" in your RRSP for a contribution of
						that amount you could move your savings into a registered investment at
						least 90 days before your closing date. Then, simply withdraw the money
						through the Home Buyers' Plan. </p><p>The advantage? Your $20,000 RRSP
						contribution will count as a tax deduction this year. Use any tax
						refund you receive to repay the RRSP or other expenses related to
						buying your home. </p><p>While using your RRSP for a down payment may
						help you buy a home sooner, it can also mean missing some tax-sheltered
						growth. So be sure to ask your financial planner whether this strategy
						makes sense for you, given your personal financial situation.</p></div>

						determine 'affordability' you will first need to know your taxable
						income along with the amount of any debt outstanding and the monthly
						payments. Assuming it is your principal residence, you are purchasing;
						calculate 32% of your income use toward a mortgage payment, property
						taxes, and heating costs. If applicable, half of the estimated monthly
						condominium maintenance fees will also be included in this calculation.
						</p><p>Second, calculate 40% of your taxable income and deduct all of
						your monthly debt payments, including car loans, credit cards, lines of
						credit payments. The lesser of the first or second calculation will be
						used to help determine how much of your income may be used towards
						housing related payments, including your mortgage payment. These
						calculations are based on lenders' usual guidelines. </p><p>In
						addition to considering, what the ratios say you can afford, make sure
						you calculate how much you think you can afford. If the payment amount
						you are comfortable with is less than 32% of your income, you may want
						to settle for the lower amount rather than stretch yourself
						financially. Make sure you don't leave yourself house poor. Structure

						<p class="txtNormal"><a name="7"></a></p><div class="faqsubject">How much mortgage can I afford? </div><div class="faqbody"><p>The
						amount of a mortgage for which one can qualify is generally founded in
						what are known as qualification ratios: Gross Debt Service ratio and
						Total Debt Service ratio, or "GDS" and "TDS". Lenders evaluate one's
						monthly income, as well as their monthly debt obligations, to determine
						a fair and feasible amount of mortgage available to the prospective
						borrower. This figure is calculated via their GDS and TDS guidelines.
						Generally, lenders will have an acceptable Gross Debt Service ratio
						ranging from 28-32%. In other words, 28-32% of one's monthly household
						income can be reasonably set aside for one's mortgage payment, in the
						eyes of the lender. Furthermore, most lenders will have an acceptable
						Total Debt Service ratio of 36-40%. In other words, 36-40% of one's
						monthly household income can be reasonably set aside for one's total
						debt obligations, including their impending mortgage payment. To
						calculate exactly how much you may borrow, please refer to our
						CALCULATOR available by clicking on the HOME tab above. Make sure that
						you incorporate the proper interest rate, as this can have a profound
						effect over the life of a mortgage. NOTE: As part of this calculation,
						you also need to estimate and include the property taxes, homeowner's
						insurance, and CMHC fees (if applicable) you might need to pay.</p></div>

						<p class="txtNormal"><a name="15"></a></p><div class="faqsubject">What is the difference between Pre-approval, Pre-qualification, and Mortgage Commitment? </div><div class="faqbody"><p>If
						you are just getting started in the hunt for a new home, it is
						important to know the difference between pre-qualifying, pre-approval
						and a loan commitment. It is not enough to simply begin looking for the
						home of your dreams. It is critical that you determine the price range
						that you can afford, get qualified for a loan, and understand all of
						the steps to assist you in securing that perfect property when you find
						it. </p>
						<i>Pre-Qualification</i><br>
						<p>Pre-qualification does not mean that you have been approved for a
						loan, but it is an important component of the home buying process. You
						have to know what you can afford before you look. Pre-qualification
						will save you time and ultimately money. </p>
						<p>A mortgage professional can help you determine your qualification.
						You should candidly discuss your financial situation with him or her
						and not withhold any information. Most likely, your mortgage consultant
						will want to know your yearly household income as well as your assets
						and liabilities. If you can discuss your finances candidly and
						determine what you can reasonably qualify for a loan, then no one's
						time will be wasted. Otherwise, your agent may end up being a tour
						guide, showing you beautiful houses that you will never be able to get
						a mortgage for rather than helping you find an appropriate property to
						make an offer on. However, pre-qualification does not mean that much to
						sellers. It is more of a tool to help potential buyers figure out their
						price range. </p>
						<i>Pre-Approval </i><br>
						<p>Pre-approval is a firmer commitment that is based on more
						information than pre-qualification. A mortgage broker or lender will
						need to do a thorough credit investigation and it is particularly
						important that you disclose all financial information that is
						requested. The amount that you are approved for will be the amount that
						the lender is committed to loan for the purchase of a house. Getting
						pre-approval may give you more bargaining power when you are
						negotiating the price of a home. </p>
						<p>If the seller knows that you are approved for the loan, already you
						may have more leverage. In fact, it is a good idea to plan to get
						pre-approved. Some real estate agents will not waste their time showing
						homes to potential buyers who do not have a pre-approval, especially in
						a hot market. However, pre-approval does not necessarily mean that you
						will ultimately get the loan. The final approval will still depend on
						verification of the information provided and approval of the home you
						wish to purchase. </p>
						<i>Mortgage Commitment</i><br>
						<p>A loan commitment is a letter that is issued by the lender that
						states that they will fund your mortgage. This letter may include
						details of your interest rate and the maximum amount of loan they will
						offer. This sort of commitment requires that both you and the house be
						approved. This means that the home will need to be appraised at the
						sale price or higher and must meet the lender's guidelines. </p>
						<p>Regardless of what stage of home buying you are in, it is very
						important that you keep a few things in mind. Remember that just
						because you are approved for a large loan, does not necessarily mean
						that you should borrow at the upper limit of your loan approval.
						Homeownership involves more expenses than renting and some properties
						need more work than others need. Make sure you leave a financial
						cushion for repairs and upgrades to your new home. </p><p>Once you are approved, do not make any big changes to your
						finances. Changing jobs, banks and taking out other loans can lower
						your credit rating, change your debt-to-income ratio and ultimately
						keep you from getting the loan. Now is not the time to buy that new
						car, big screen television or to take an expensive vacation. The
						mortgage company may make one last credit check even if you have a loan
						commitment. If you are educated and prepared, you may find that the
						home buying process is easy and stress free.</p></div>

						walls, floors, ceilings, windows, doors, foundation, and basement. If
						the inspector finds problems, it does not mean you cannot sell your
						house, but you can be certain a buyer inspection will find them too.
						Finding problems before you list your property can avoid accusations of
						misrepresentation, low offers, and even lawsuits. A home inspection can
						also help sellers comply with new, tougher disclosure laws enforced in
						many states.</p><p>You may or may not want to make the repairs and you
						can always adjust the selling price or contract terms if the problems
						are major. This information will also help you determine what type of
						financing will or will not be available for your home. You can find
						home inspectors under Professional Services section.</p></div>

						can be added directly onto the mortgage amount. This is not the same as

						<p class="txtNormal"><a name="21"></a></p><div class="faqsubject">What is the difference between Term and Amortization? </div><div class="faqbody"><p>The
						"term" of the mortgage should not be confused with the "amortization".
						The amortization of the mortgage refers to the entire length of time
						that it will take for the mortgage to be paid and the house to be "free
						and clear". The term is the period for which your current payment
						obligations are valid. In other words, you may choose a five-year term
						and a 25-year amortization. This would mean that your interest rate,
						your payments, and your pre-payment options would be the same for the
						next five years. At the end of these five years, you would re-negotiate
						the term, and the amortization would now be 20 years. Fixed rate
						mortgages can be "closed" or "open".</p>
						<p>
						<i>Open Mortgages</i><br>
						Allow one to pre-pay some, or all of, their outstanding mortgage
						obligation at any time, without penalty. Generally, open mortgages have
						a six-month, and a one-year term option with higher interest rates than
						closed mortgages of the same term length. </p>
						<p><i>Closed Mortgages</i><br>
						Generally, closed mortgages are offered in terms ranging from six
						months to ten years. Generally, closed mortgages offer more stringent
						pre-payment options subject to various pre-set regulations. For most
						people, such pre-payment options can be vital to reducing the
						amortization of one's mortgage and should be properly discussed with
						one's lender/agent. </p></div>

						<p class="txtNormal"><a name="22"></a></p><div class="faqsubject">Should I wait for my mortgage to mature before renewing? </div><div class="faqbody"><p>Lenders
						will often guarantee an interest rate to you as much as 90 days before
						your mortgage matures. Moreover, as long as you are not increasing your
						mortgage, they will cover the costs of transferring your mortgage too.
						This means a rate promised well in advance of your maturity date, thus
						eliminating any worries of higher rates. In addition, if rates drop
						before the actual maturity rate, the new lender will usually adjust
						your interest rate lower as well. </p><p>Most lenders send out their
						mortgage renewal notices offering existing clients their posted
						interest rates. The rate you are being offered is usually not the best
						one. Always investigate the possibility of a lower interest rate with
						the lender or another lender. Or contact your local Mortgagebrokers.com

						you have to make sure you have enough money for a down payment - the
						portion of the purchase price that you furnish yourself. </p>
						
						<p>To qualify for a conventional mortgage you will need a down payment
						of 20% or more. However, you can qualify for a low down payment insured
						mortgage with a down payment as low as 5%. </p>
						
						<p>Secondly, you will require money for closing costs (up to 1.5% of the basic purchase price).  </p>
						
						<p>If you want to have the home inspected by a professional building
						inspector - which we highly recommend - you will need to pay an
						inspection fee. The inspection may bring to light areas where repairs
						or maintenance are required and will assure you that the house is
						structurally sound. Usually the inspector will provide you with a
						written report. If they do not, then ask for one. </p>
						
						<p>You will be responsible for paying the fees and disbursements for
						the lawyer or notary acting for you in the purchase of your home. We
						suggest you shop around before making your decision on who you are
						going to use, because fees for these services may vary significantly. </p>
						
						<p>There are closing and adjustment costs, interest adjustment costs
						between buyer and seller and (depending on where you live) land
						transfer tax - a one-time tax based on a percentage of the purchase
						price of the property and/or mortgage amount. </p>
						
						<p>Finally, you will be required to have property insurance in place by
						the closing date. In addition, you will be responsible for the cost of
						moving. </p>
						
						<p>Remember, there will be all kinds of things you will have to
						purchase early on - appliances, garden tools, cleaning materials etc.
						So factor these expenses into your initial costs.</p></div>

						length of mortgage terms varies widely - from six months right up to 10
						years. As a rule of thumb, the shorter the term, the lower the interest
						rate the longer the term, the higher the rate. </p>
						<p>While four or five year mortgages are what most home buyers
						typically choose, you may consider a short-term mortgage if you have a
						higher tolerance for risk, if you have time to watch rates or are not
						prepared to make a long-term commitment right now. </p>
						<p>Before selecting your mortgage term, we suggest you answer the following questions: 
						</p>
						<ol style="margin: 6px 0px 6px 10px;">
						<li>Do you plan to sell your house in the short-term without buying another?  If so, a short mortgage term may be the best option. 
						</li><li>Do you believe that interest rates have bottomed out and are
						not likely to drop more? If that is the case, a long mortgage term may
						be the right choice for you. Similarly, if you think rates are
						currently high, you may want to opt for a short to medium length
						mortgage term hoping that rates drop by the time your term expires. </li><li>Are you looking for security as a first-time homebuyer? Then
						you may prefer a longer mortgage term, so that you can budget for and
						manage your monthly expenses. </li><li>Are you willing to follow interest rates closely and risk
						their being increased mortgage payments following a renewal? If that is
						the case, a short mortgage term may best suit your needs. </li></ol>

						<p class="txtNormal"><a name="26"></a></p><div class="faqsubject">What are the monthly costs of owning a home? </div><div class="faqbody"><p>You will have financial responsibilities as a homeowner.  </p>
						<p>Some of them, like taxes, may not be billed monthly, so do the
						calculations to break them down into monthly costs. Below you will find
						a list of these expenses. </p>
						<p><i>The Mortgage Payment</i><br>
						For most homebuyers, this is the largest monthly expense. The actual
						amount of the mortgage payment can vary widely since it is based on a
						number of variables, such as mortgage term or amortization. </p>
						<p><i>Property Taxes</i><br>
						Property tax can be paid in two ways - remitted directly to the
						municipality by you, in which case you may be required to periodically
						show proof of payment to your financial institution; or paid as part of
						your monthly mortgage payment. </p>
						<p><i>School Taxes</i><br>
						In some municipalities, these taxes are integrated into the property
						taxes. In others, they are collected separately and are payable in a
						single lump sum, usually due at the end of the current school year. </p>
						<p><i>Utilities</i><br>
						As a homeowner, you will be responsible for all utility bills including
						heating, gas, electricity, water, telephone, and cable. </p>
						<p><i>Maintenance and Upkeep</i><br>
						You will also have to cover the cost of painting, roof repairs,
						electrical and plumbing, walks and driveway, lawn care and snow
						removal. A well-maintained property helps to preserve your home's
						market value, enhances the neighbourhood and, depending on the kind of
						renovations you make could add to the worth of your property.

						simplest way to accomplish this is to decrease your principal; thus,
						decreasing your interest obligation. There are a number of very
						feasible approaches to performing this task: </p>
						<p>Increase Payment Frequency - Instead of paying monthly, consider
						paying bi-weekly. This simple step is very feasible for most working
						Canadians who are paid bi-weekly. It can cut your mortgage amortization
						by up to five years, and can save you tens of thousands of dollars. </p>
						<p>Prepay - Use every advantage that the term of your mortgage offers
						you to prepay your mortgage. One way to do this would be to use your
						RRSP tax refund to make a yearly pre-payment. </p>
						<p>Increase Payments - Round up your bi-weekly payment. For example, if
						you have a bi-weekly payment of $531.59, round your payment to an even
						$550.00. This will have a profound effect on the interest paid, and the
						amortization of the mortgage. </p></div>
